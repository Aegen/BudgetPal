Starting point:
MainActivity.java
  Code execution starts here then progresses to the other classes as specified in the code.

The following all correspond to pages within the app:
AddEvent.java
AddExpenses.java
CreateUser.java
EventDetailActivity.java
ExpenseDetailsActivity.java
LandingPage.java
MainActivity.java
SetBudget.java
StatisticsActivity.java
ViewEvents.java
ViewHistory.java

There are layouts that go with each of these in the res folder. All other java classes are called
from those classes.

SwitchManager controls the flow from one page to another so anytime it's called means that
the page is switching.

Every page begins execution at the onCreate method in the above classes.

A lot of the code is asynchronous so it can be hard to understand at times.

Beyond that it should be fairly straightforward from their.
